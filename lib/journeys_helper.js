        "text": "Welcome to Porte Saint-Denis! a Parisian monument located at the site of one of the gates of the Wall of Charles V, one of the now-destroyed fortifications of Paris. he Porte Saint-Denis was designed by architect Francois Blondel and the sculptor Michel Anguier at the order of Louis XIV in honor of his victories on the Rhine and in Franche-Comte. Built in 1672 and paid for by the city of Paris, it replaced a medieval gate in the city walls built by Charles V in the 14th century. The Porte Saint-Denis is a triumphal arch inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome. It is pierced by a large central arch and formerly by two much smaller flanking pedestrian openings in the pedestals, now closed off. The arch is flanked by obelisks applied to the wall face bearing sculptural groups of trophies of arms. Above the main arch, the southern face carries a sculptural group by Michel Anguier of 'The Passage of the Rhine' in a sunk panel, while the north face carries allegorical figures of the Rhine and the Netherlands. The entablature bears the gilded bronze inscription LUDOVICO MAGNO, 'To Louis the Great'. In total it is 24.65 meters high, 25 meters wide, and five meters deep. After you've had a chance to be inspired by the huge monument, move on to our next stop.",

Although short-lived, lasting only eight years, the theatere's pioneering naturalism proved extremely influential. Antoine departed in 1894 under financial pressure, the enterprise closed in 1896, but Antoine returned the following year to the renamed Theatre Antoine with a more deliberately provocative program that lasted until 1906. check out the board (or their website: http://www.theatre-antoine.com/) and book a show for later this week.",

While Le Corbusier’s political leanings might be controversial, he was committed to improving the quality of urban life through design. Villa La Roche stands today as an example of how the housing and living needs of single-unit and multi-unit families might reconcile and co-exist.
