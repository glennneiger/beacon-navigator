# Expectations

On the home page, when I press the button:

  + I should see a spinner and a message telling me what's going on.
  + When there are beacons around me, I should be redirected to the index page, where I should see a list of the beacons.
  + When there are no beacons around me, I should see an alert message.

On the index page:

  + I should see list comprised of at least one beacon.
  + When I click the back button, I should be redirected to the home page.
  + When I click the beacon list item, I should be redirected to the show page for that beacon.

On the show page:

  + I should see details about the point of interest represented by that beacon.
  + When I press the back button, I should be redirected back to the index page, where I should see the same list I saw before navigating to the show page.
